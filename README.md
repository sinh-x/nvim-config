# NeoVim Configuration for R Programming by Sinh

This repository contains my personal NeoVim configuration. I've used it to
explore different NeoVim distributions and to set up a local R Development
Environment on my computer. The repository includes the following
branches:

- AstroVim
- LazyVim
- NvChad
- scratch - This is a setup from scratch, following the YouTube guide by Josean
  . You can find his development environment files [here](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files).

After trying out different configurations, I've settled on LazyVim for now as
it offers a comprehensive out-of-the-box experience. Still, I found NvChad
particularly useful for learning about the structure of Lua and configuration
parameters. If you're new to NeoVim, I recommend starting with NvChad due to
its minimalism and easy-to-understand documentation and structure. Once you
understand the basics of Lua and configuration parameters, the choice of
distribution becomes less important, allowing you to focus on what truly
matters: coding and getting work done.

## LazyVim

LazyVim is a starter template that I'm currently using. You can find more
information about [LazyVim here](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and refer
to the [official documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
